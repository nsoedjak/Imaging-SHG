# Imaging-SHG
This is a MATLAB code for solving an inverse problem in quantitative thermoacoustic tomography in the presence of second harmonic generation (SHG), based on the Helmholtz model for wave propagation. This code accompanies the paper [1], where theoretical results on the inverse problem may also be found. All of the numerical experiments in that paper can be reproduced by simply running the appropriate example file (e.g., Experiment-I_gamma.m). 

A summary of the mathematics underlying the code can be found in the file Readme-SHG.pdf.
